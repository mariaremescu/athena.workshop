 What the Project Is:
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game built in Python.  
The player tries to guess the hidden word, letter by letter before running out of lives.  
It runs in the terminal and has difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), it tracks the lives and tells you if you won or you didn't put the right answer

Why I Made This Project:
I wanted to practice Python basics like loops, conditionals, lists, while also making a little game that everyone knows.  
Creating a simple game is the perfect start in understanding more about coding.

How I Made It:
- The list of possible words is stored in a text file called 'dictionary.txt', where each word is separated by " , ".
- The game randomly chooses one word each round.
- The player chooses a difficulty level (which changes the number of lives).
- The program keeps track of:
  - Correct guesses
  - Wrong guesses
  - Remaining lives
- The game ends when you either guess all the letters or run out of lives.
- If you lose, you can choose to play again.

What I Struggled With and What I Learned:
- Remembering how to use the lists and how to use "print" with them.
- Realising what I've done wrong and finding a solution for it even tho it took me a little to find the correct code.
- Figuring out how to check if the player had won without makeing the code more complicated.
- Organizing my code so it was readable and easy to restart the game.

How to Run It:

    First you need to have a 'dictionary.txt' file in the same folder as 'hangman.py'

    1.Clone this repository
    git clone https://github.com/mariaremescu/athena.workshop

    2.Run the game

    3.Choose your difficulty (easy / medium / hard) and start guessing letters!
